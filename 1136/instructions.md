##Wall Drawing #1136 (2004)

The actual letter of instruction is unavailable, but the Tate <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lewitt-wall-drawing-1136-ar00165/text-summary">provides</a> this
information:

The work is composed of both curved and straight solid bands of colour that are
painted directly onto the surface of a wall using every primary (red, yellow,
blue) and secondary (green, orange, purple) colour plus grey. The curve, made up
of nine interlocking bands in these seven colours (there are two bands each of
red and green), snakes along the wall, touching the top and bottom of the wall
at various points. The same seven colours reappear, in an irregular sequence,
as vertical bands that serve as a background pattern for the curve. Every band
in the wall drawing is of the same width and there is no area left empty of
colour.

Vertical lines of equal width cover the wall, in this order:
